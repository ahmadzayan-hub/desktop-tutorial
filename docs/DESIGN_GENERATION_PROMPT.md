# Design-generation prompt · Tweenz AI Learning OS (Maktab)

Copy-paste ready prompt for feeding into a 2026 AI design-generation tool
(**v0.dev** recommended — same stack — with tool-specific tweaks for
Lovable, Bolt, Framer AI, and Figma Make at the bottom).

Grounded in what actually exists on `origin/main`: Next.js 14 App Router,
Supabase auth + RLS, Stripe billing, framer-motion, recharts,
react-day-picker, react-dropzone, zod, Tailwind with the tokens declared
in `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.

## 1 · Product in one paragraph

**Tweenz AI Learning OS** (Arabic name: **مكتب / Maktab**, meaning
"desk") is a bilingual (English + Arabic, full RTL) SaaS for MBA students
in the UAE. It is one workspace where a student's whole academic life
lives: courses, lectures, study packs, flashcards, quizzes, tasks,
calendar, grades, group projects, weekly briefs, and an on-demand AI
tutor plus a specialised "Ask My MBA" agent. Positioning line: **"Your
MBA, on one desk."** Users pay Student or Pro monthly / annually via
Stripe; auth + data through Supabase.

## 2 · Users you are designing for

- **Primary:** MBA students at UAE universities (AASTMT, MBS Dubai,
  Hult, Heriot-Watt). Studying part-time while working. Arabic-first for
  personal / cultural context, English-first for coursework. Mobile-
  heavy commute usage, laptop for deep work.
- **Secondary:** Course tutors / TAs (announcements, feedback).
- **Admin:** Product team (feedback triage, user stats).

## 3 · Design DNA

- **Personality**: calm, credible, adult, expensive-feeling. Think
  Notion × Linear × Apple Intelligence, not a colourful "study app" for
  teens. Bilingual serif for warmth (Fraunces), grotesque sans for
  clarity (Space Grotesk), Tajawal for Arabic.
- **Mood**: glassmorphic surfaces on soft blue-white ground, with
  ambient orbs (very low-opacity coloured blurs) drifting in the
  background. Never rainbow. Never emoji-driven.
- **References**: Linear's density and keyboard-first feel. Arc's soft
  glass. Apple Intelligence's ambient orbs. Notion Calendar's calm
  density. Cron's serif accents.
- **What to avoid**: generic "AI SaaS" clichés — no purple-to-pink
  gradients everywhere, no hero robot illustrations, no rounded-square
  3D icons, no glassmorphism on 100% of elements (only on hero
  surfaces), no chatgpt-style "type here" plaintext text areas.

## 4 · Design tokens — use exactly these

```css
/* Light mode */
--bg:             #f0f4ff;
--surface:        rgba(255,255,255,0.72);   /* glass panels */
--surface-line:   rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
--surface-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(31,38,135,0.15);

/* Dark mode */
--bg-dark:        #080c18;
--surface-dark:   rgba(15,20,40,0.75);

/* Ambient orbs (background only, blur ~180px, drifting slowly) */

--orb-4: rgba(168,85,247,0.08);   /* violet */

/* Palette */
brand:  50 #eef6ff · 500 #3b82f6 · 600 #2563eb (primary) · 700 #1d4ed8 · 950 #172554
navy:   50 #f0f4ff · 500 #4f56f5 · 700 #2f2ecf · 950 #16164d
teal:   500 #14b8a6 · 700 #0f766e (secondary + success)
gold:   500 #f59e0b (accent, sparingly, for achievements/streaks)
ink:    slate-900 #0f172a (light) · slate-200 #e2e8f0 (dark)
```

**Fonts (Google Fonts):**
- Sans: `Space Grotesk` (400, 500, 600, 700)
- Display / serif accent: `Fraunces` (400 opt-size, 600, 700, italic)
- Arabic: `Tajawal` (400, 500, 700, 900) — automatically swap when `[dir="rtl"]`
- Mono: `JetBrains Mono` **as a CSS fallback stack only** — it is not loaded from Google Fonts; expect the user's system monospace unless installed locally

**Radius:** 12px controls · 20px cards · 28px hero surfaces · 999px pills.
**Spacing:** 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 px scale.
**Elevation:** never native `box-shadow: 0 4px 6px black`. Use the
`--surface-shadow` glass drop only.
**Motion:** Framer Motion. Every mount uses `fade-up` (10px, 240 ms,
easeOut). Stagger children by 60 ms (`stagger-1 .. stagger-5`). Hover on
cards lifts 2 px + subtle scale 1.01 + shadow bloom.

## 5 · Bilingual + RTL requirements

- `<html lang>` and `dir` swap live via a header toggle. Layout uses
  Tailwind logical properties (`ps-*`, `pe-*`, `ms-*`, `me-*`,
  `start-*`, `end-*`) — no `pl-*` / `pr-*` in components.
- Arabic font (`Tajawal`) auto-applied via `html[dir="rtl"] body`.
  Fraunces is Latin-only — Arabic headings switch to Tajawal in
  `[dir="rtl"] h1, h2`.
- Chevrons, arrows, and stepper progress **mirror** when RTL. Icons keep
  their orientation (no mirrored search glass).
- All copy comes in `{ en, ar }` pairs.

## 6 · Priority screens (build in this order)

Design each as a full page, with the **shared app chrome** (§7) always
visible.

### 6.1 · `/dashboard` — Home

The one screen a user opens 20× a day. Density comparable to Notion
Calendar or Linear inbox.

- **Hero KPI row** (4 cards): current week's tasks due, unread
  announcements, current course GPA trend, streak (days studied). Each
  card is glass-surface, 20 px radius, with a tiny sparkline + one-line
  insight ("You're 12% ahead of last week"). Colour-code: brand-blue,
  amber, teal-emerald, gold.
- **Next class** panel (large, prominent): course name, time, room or
  Zoom link, one-tap "Prep in 5 min" button that opens the study pack
  for that lecture.
- **Weekly brief** (right column, 320 px): AI-generated summary of the
  week — top 3 focus items, one paragraph, "regenerate" button. Sourced
  from `/api/weekly-brief`.
- **Quick actions** row: Upload lecture · Ask my MBA · New study pack ·
  Add task. Uses `react-dropzone` for the upload target (drag anywhere
  on the page).
- **Course tiles** grid: 6 courses max, each with a progress ring
  (assignments completed), colour band, next deadline chip.
- **RTL variant** flips the sidebar to the right, chevrons mirror,
  everything else mirrors via logical properties.

### 6.2 · `/ask-mba` — Ask My MBA agent (the killer feature)

Bilingual conversational chat with an MBA-domain agent.

- Left rail: session list (grouped by course), pinned threads on top,
  search.
- Centre column: chat transcript. Bubbles are glass panels, sender name
  is small caps above, timestamp on hover. Streaming responses render
  with a soft cursor. Every AI reply carries **inline source pills**
  (course PDF, lecture recording, Kotler chapter) — clickable, opens
  the source in a right-side drawer.
- The composer is **not** a plain textarea. It has: a chip strip above
  (`@course`, `@lecture`, `#topic`) that filters retrieval; a
  language-toggle pill (EN / AR); an attachment button
  (react-dropzone); a "Send + copy" secondary action.
- **Empty state**: three suggestion cards — "Explain Porter's 5 Forces
  in the Careem case", "Draft a 200-word answer to yesterday's HRM quiz
  Q3", "شرح ماتريكس بوسطن بالعربي" — each pre-fills the composer.
- **Model picker** in the top-right (Anthropic / OpenAI); saved per
  thread.

### 6.3 · `/study-packs` — Study Packs

An AI-generated study pack is a bundle of: summary + flashcards +
practice quiz + citations for one lecture or chapter.

- Grid of pack cards, filterable by course. Each card shows: cover
  gradient (course colour), pack title, "12 flashcards · 8 questions · 3
  min read", freshness badge ("Generated today"), progress bar (how many
  flashcards mastered).
- Prominent "Generate new pack" CTA at the top — opens a modal with a
  file dropzone + course picker + language.
- Pack detail view is a **3-tab** layout: Summary · Flashcards · Quiz.
  Flashcards are horizontal swipe (mobile) or arrow-keys (desktop). Quiz
  is one-question-at-a-time with immediate feedback + explanation.

### 6.4 · `/lecture` — Lecture upload + processing

- Big dropzone at top ("Drop the lecture recording, slides, or PDF").
  Accepts `.mp3 .mp4 .pdf .pptx`.
- Below: processing timeline — Transcribing → Summarising → Extracting
  flashcards → Generating quiz → Done. Each step gets a soft glass tile
  with a progress bar or check.
- On completion: three CTAs — View summary · Open study pack · Email me
  a copy (uses `/api/lecture/email`).

### 6.5 · `/courses` + `/courses/[id]`

- Index: grid of enrolled courses, each with colour band, next
  assignment, current grade, cover image.
- Detail: tabs for Syllabus · Lectures · Assignments · Grades · Files ·
  Group projects. Each tab is a dense table (Linear-style) with sticky
  header, keyboard row nav.

### 6.6 · `/calendar` + `/timeline`

- Calendar: month + week views using `react-day-picker`; overlay events
  for assignments, quizzes, lectures. Colour-coded per course.
  Drag-to-reschedule.
- Timeline: a horizontal Gantt showing the semester at a glance — each
  course as a swim lane, deadlines as pills.

### 6.7 · `/tasks`

- Kanban board (columns: To do · Doing · Waiting · Done) with drag-drop.
  Each card carries course badge, due date pill (colour-graded by
  urgency), one-line description. Keyboard shortcuts (J/K/X/Enter).

### 6.8 · `/subscription` + `/pricing`

- Public pricing page has 3 tiers: Free (limited) · Student · Pro.
  Two-column comparison, feature table, "Start free" CTA, monthly ↔
  annual toggle with "Save 20%" badge.
- Signed-in `/subscription` shows current plan, next billing date, usage
  meters (AI-tutor messages this month, storage), upgrade / cancel
  buttons that call the Stripe portal.

### 6.9 · `/settings`

- Left rail sections: Account · Notifications · Language & region · Data
  & privacy (PDPL — export my data / delete my account) · Integrations ·
  Developers (API keys).
- Right column: dense forms, save-on-blur with a toast confirmation.

### 6.10 · `/(public)` marketing

- Landing (`/`): hero (headline + subhead + primary CTA + secondary "See
  how it works" ghost), a live product screenshot (mobile + laptop
  mockup), 6 feature tiles, testimonials, pricing preview, footer.
- `/features`, `/how-it-works`, `/for-students`, `/pricing`, `/faq`,
  `/contact`, `/terms`, `/privacy` — same header/footer, one hero +
  content section each.
- Above-fold on landing has one clear CTA. No "Enter your email" nag
  before the user knows what the product does.

## 7 · Shared app chrome (every authenticated screen)

- **Left sidebar (268 px)**: logo (Maktab wordmark), primary sections
  (Dashboard, Courses, Study Packs, Tasks, Calendar, Ask My MBA, Files,
  Grades, Settings), collapsible on `<lg`. Sticky. Bottom of sidebar has
  the user avatar + plan badge.
- **Top bar (56 px, sticky)**: breadcrumbs, global command palette
  (Cmd/Ctrl+K opens a Linear-style overlay), theme toggle, language
  toggle, notifications bell, help.
- **Mobile**: sidebar becomes a slide-in drawer; a bottom tab bar
  (5 tabs) appears with Dashboard · Ask MBA · Tasks · Study Packs · Me.
- **Empty states**: friendly, illustrated, one clear next action. Never
  "No data yet."
- **Loading**: skeleton screens (never spinners) that match the final
  layout.
- **Errors**: inline banners with an action ("Retry" · "Report"), not
  modal alerts.

## 8 · Motion + interactions

- Page mount: parent uses `layout` + `AnimatePresence`, children
  `fade-up` staggered.
- Hover: card `translateY(-2px)` + shadow bloom, 180 ms easeOut.
- Cmd+K palette: modal springs in from 0.96 scale + backdrop blur 8 px.
- Progress bars: `animate-shimmer` at the leading edge while
  indeterminate.
- Ambient orbs: 4 large blurred coloured circles positioned in the
  corners of the viewport, drifting slowly (`animate-float-slow`, 20 s
  cycle, translate ± 40 px).
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all non-essential motion.

## 9 · Responsiveness

Design for these viewports: **360 · 390 · 768 · 1024 · 1440 · 1920**.
Mobile-first CSS. Touch targets ≥ 44 × 44 px. Type scale reduces on
`<sm` (h1 44→32, h2 32→24). Sidebar hides on `<lg`, replaced by bottom
tab bar.

## 10 · Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast; large text and non-text UI 3:1.
- Keyboard-first navigation everywhere. Every interactive element has
  visible focus (2 px ring in brand-500 with 2 px offset).
- Every icon-only button has an `aria-label`.
- Modal dialogs trap focus, restore on close, close on Escape.
- Live regions announce toasts + streaming AI responses.
- RTL layouts pass the same audit; do not lose logical order.

## 11 · Constraints — what NOT to do

- No purple-to-pink gradients, no rainbow accents, no glow-on-every-
  button.
- No stock "AI" 3D illustrations, no generic hero photo of "students
  studying".
- No emojis in navigation, buttons, or headings (allowed only in user-
  generated content).
- No skeuomorphic drop shadows on text.
- No "Coming soon" placeholders — if a screen isn't ready, don't render
  it.
- No English-only labels on RTL screens; both languages ship together,
  not "add Arabic later".
- No autoplay video, no sound.
- No cookie banner on landing beyond the actual PDPL requirement.

## 12 · Tech constraints (for code-generating tools)

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router (`src/app`), TypeScript, React
  18, `use client` only where needed.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (config already defined), `clsx`, no CSS-
  in-JS.
- **Components**: shadcn/ui as the base, extended with the design
  tokens above. Icons from `lucide-react`.
- **Motion**: `framer-motion` v12.
- **Forms**: `react-hook-form` + `zod` for validation.
- **Charts**: `recharts` (already installed).
- **Dates**: `date-fns` + `react-day-picker`.
- **Uploads**: `react-dropzone`.
- **Auth data**: assume `@supabase/ssr` and RLS-scoped queries — don't
  design flows that require public reads of private tables.
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout redirect, not embedded card fields.
- **Output structure**: one file per route
  (`src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`), shared components in
  `src/components/`, hooks in `src/hooks/`, types in `src/lib/types.ts`.

## 13 · Tool-specific tuning

**v0.dev (recommended, matches stack):**

- Paste §1–§12 as the prompt. In the first message, name shadcn
  primitives you want: `Card`, `Button`, `Tabs`, `Sheet`, `Dialog`,
  `Command`, `Badge`, `Skeleton`.
- Iterate one screen at a time, starting with `/dashboard`. Ask v0 to
  "extend the same design system" on each subsequent screen.
- End every prompt with: *"Do not use any purple gradient. Do not use
  lucide's `Sparkles` icon."*

**Lovable:**

- Paste §1–§12 as the initial brief. Explicitly say: *"Use the
  Next.js 14 App Router with Supabase Auth Helpers. Do not create a new
  backend."*
- Ask for the marketing site + auth flow + dashboard as separate builds
  so you can review each.

**Bolt (StackBlitz):**

- Same as v0. Prefer Bolt when you want a fully-runnable preview in-
  browser without deploying.

**Figma Make / Framer AI (design-only, no code):**

- Feed §1–§11 (skip §12). Ask for a component library first
  (typography, colours, buttons, cards, inputs, badges, glass surfaces),
  then compose the screens from it. Include one dark-mode variant of the
  dashboard.
- Explicitly request bilingual mockups: one EN screen and its RTL
  Arabic mirror, side by side.

**Galileo AI / Uizard:**

- Paste §1–§4 + §6 + §11. These tools work best with dense product
  briefs and short screen lists.

## 14 · Priming line (paste as the very first sentence)

> *"Design a bilingual (English + Arabic RTL) SaaS product called
> Tweenz AI Learning OS ('Maktab') for UAE MBA students — a single
> workspace for courses, AI tutoring, study packs, tasks, and grades.
> Adult, calm, glassmorphic on soft blue-white, ambient orbs, Space
> Grotesk + Fraunces + Tajawal. No AI clichés."*

_Version 1. Update this file when tokens (`src/app/globals.css`,
`tailwind.config.ts`) or route structure (`src/app/(app)/**`) change —
the prompt drifts if the code drifts._
